## Project Overview

This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of retail sales using the UCI retail sales dataset. The analysis encompasses various methodologies to derive actionable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and forecasting. Key components of the project include:

- **Cohort Analysis**: Identifying customer segments based on their acquisition date to understand retention rates over time and improve loyalty strategies.

- **Retention Analysis**: Measuring customer retention by evaluating repeat purchase behavior, helping to inform marketing and engagement strategies.

- **Pareto Analysis**: Applying the 80/20 principle to uncover which products account for the majority of sales, enabling targeted marketing and inventory management.

- **RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)**: Segmenting customers based on their purchase patterns to enhance targeted marketing efforts and optimize customer relationships.

- **Sales Forecasting using FB Prophet**: Utilizing the FB Prophet library for time series forecasting to predict future sales trends, aiding in better inventory and resource planning.

By integrating these analyses, the project provides comprehensive insights that can inform strategic decisions in retail management, ultimately enhancing customer engagement and operational efficiency.
